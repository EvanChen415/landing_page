# league_of_legends_landing_page
Note: Open in FULL-SCREEN!
This project is a culmination of basic HTML/CSS that I learned over the summer in my limited free time. 
This project is a League of Legends Fan Page that answers a few questions about my relationship to LoL and gives biographies about a few champions.
